Memory Card Game
Description:
This Memory Card Game is a fun and interactive challenge designed to test your concentration and memory. Players are presented with a set of cards placed face down, and their task is to match all pairs within the allotted time. With each level, the difficulty increases, pushing players to sharpen their skills as they advance.

Levels: The game has three levels:

Level 1: Match all the pairs within 1 minute.
Level 2: Complete the challenge within 2 minutes.
Level 3: Finish the game in under 3 minutes.
Each level comes with an increasing number of cards, making it progressively more difficult!

Progress Tracking:

A message will inform you once you have matched a quarter or half of the cards.
Complete all matches, and you'll be rewarded with a congratulatory message.
Challenges:
If you exceed the time limit for any level, the game is over, and you'll have to try again. So, act fast and stay focused!

This game is perfect for all ages and provides a great way to improve memory, focus, and cognitive skills while having fun. Challenge yourself to beat the clock, improve your score, and complete all the levels!

How to Play:

Choose a level to start.
Flip two cards to reveal their faces.
If the cards match, they remain face-up.
If they don't match, they flip back down, and you can try again.
Continue until all pairs are matched, but be careful of the timer!


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
